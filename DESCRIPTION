Description: Helps with quality checks, visualizations 
    and analysis of mass spectrometry data, coming from proteomics 
    experiments. The package is developed, tested and used at the Functional 
    Genomics Center Zurich <https://fgcz.ch>. We use this package
    mainly for prototyping, teaching, and having fun with proteomics data.
    But it can also be used to do data analysis for small scale data sets.
